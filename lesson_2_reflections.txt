What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

      Git puts a .git folder in your project folder that creates a local
      repository. It is used to track changes to your code commits and also to
      move the repository.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

      The staging area is preparing the file to be committed, allowing you to
      control what commits are made. The working directory is a work in progress
      that will continue to change.
